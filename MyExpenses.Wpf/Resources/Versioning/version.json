(This was a hotfix for 0.74)\r\n - Applied the fix for the context menu pop-ups to the logic that decides which windows can be snapped.\r\n - Reworked the \"Keep windows in their zones\" option to include the work area and turn it on by default, fixing an incompatibility with the Copilot flyout.\r\n - Fixed an issue causing windows to be snapped while moving to a different virtual desktop.\r\n\r\n### File Explorer add-ons\r\n\r\n - Fixed an issue blocking some SVG files from being previewed correctly.

Thanks [@fredso90](https://github.com/fredso90)!\r\n\r\n### Mouse Jump\r\n\r\n - The process now runs in the background, for a faster activation time. Thanks [@mikeclayton](https://github.com/mikeclayton)!\r\n\r\n### Peek\r\n\r\n - Reported file sizes will now more closely match what's reported by File Explorer. Thanks [@Deepak-Sangle](https://github.com/Deepak-Sangle)!\r\n - Added a previewer that hosts File Explorer previewers to support every file type that a machine is currently able to preview. Thanks [@dillydylann](https://github.com/dillydylann)!\r\n - Fixed an issue causing the preview of the first file to be stuck loading. Thanks [@davidegiacometti](https://github.com/davidegiacometti)!\r\n - Fixed showing the previously previewed video file when invoking Peek with a new file.

Thanks [@davidegiacometti](https://github.com/davidegiacometti)!\r\n - Improved the shell selection option for Windows Terminal in the Shell plugin and improved the backend code for adding combo box options to plugins. Thanks [@htcfreek](https://github.com/htcfreek)!\r\n   * The implementation of the combo box items has changed amd isn't backward compatible. (Old plugins won't crash, but the combo box setting isn't shown in settings ui anymore.)\r\n - Added Unix time in milliseconds, fixed negative unix time input and improved error messages in the TimeDate plugin.

When compared to 0.71, the 0.72 x64 machine installed version of PowerToys reduces the size reported in the Installed Apps screen from 1.15GB to 785 MB and the size in File Explorer properties for the installation folder from 3.10GB to 554 MB.\r\n - Value Generator - A new PowerToys Run plugin that generates hashes and GUID values. Thanks [@IHorvalds](https://github.com/IHorvalds)!\r\n - Mouse Highlighter has a new feature to have a highlight always follow the mouse pointer. Thanks [@hayatogh](https://github.com/hayatogh)!\r\n - PowerRename was reworked to support a bigger number of files without crashing.\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\n\r\n - Due to changing paths in the installation folder, the Mouse Without Borders service might be pointing to the wrong place. Users not running as admin will have to enable service mode again after install. A toast notification will appear if Mouse Without Borders is unable to start the service correctly.\r\n - File Explorer extensions changed paths might not be loaded correctly until File Explorer and Preview Host processes are restarted, so we advise restarting the computer when possible after updating PowerToys.\r\n \r\n ### General\r\n\r\n - Shared dependencies between applications in order to greatly reduce the installed size.\r\n - Added missing icons and icon sizes. Thanks [@niels9001](https://github.com/niels9001)!\r\n\r\n### FancyZones\r\n\r\n - Fixed an issue where FancyZones wouldn't register a change to the \"Switch between windows in the current zone\" setting.\r\n - Added a Setting to enable the behavior of clicking the middle mouse button to toggle multiple zone spanning.\r\n\r\n### File Locksmith\r\n\r\n - Fixed a File Explorer crash when deleting a file, updating PowerToys and then trying to right-click the background of a folder in File Explorer.\r\n - UI tweaks.
